Using raxml generic_ parameter.

User can enter anything in whitelist chars, except our validation
for generic parameter makes sure each arg is entered separately
with a hyphen or double hyphen and we don't allow -w and -T.

This test succeeds with generic_ arguments appearing at end of commandline.
As a result commandline specifies -n twice, with the copy from the generic
param at the end of the line as "-n foo".  Apparently this takes precedence.

Generates this command line:
raxmlHPC-PTHREADS  -f d -n result  -s infile.txt -c 25 -p 12345 -m GTRCAT   -n foo'
