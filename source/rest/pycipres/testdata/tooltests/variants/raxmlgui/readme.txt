This test suite is for raxmlgui. It was created by mamiller around 3/15/3015. The ides of March.
There is at lease one test per option, and for multi-step workflows, typically multiple tests are provided.

Some only generate a single command line, no matter the options.
These use the raxmlhpc8_xsede interface, just to maximize the flexibility available to users.
(The raxmlhpc8_xsede interface was created to accommodate the commands required by raxmlgui).
