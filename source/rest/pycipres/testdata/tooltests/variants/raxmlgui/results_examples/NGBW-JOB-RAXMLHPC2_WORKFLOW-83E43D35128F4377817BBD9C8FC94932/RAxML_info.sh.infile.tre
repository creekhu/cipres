Alignment has 256 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 4.63%

RAxML computation of SH-like support values on a given tree

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heteorgeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

Partition: 0
