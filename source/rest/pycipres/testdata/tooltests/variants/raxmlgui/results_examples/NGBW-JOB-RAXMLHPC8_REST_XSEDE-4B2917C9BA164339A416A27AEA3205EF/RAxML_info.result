Alignment has 4 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 0.00%

RAxML marginal ancestral state computation

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heteorgeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

Partition: 0
Alignment Patterns: 4
Name: No Name Provided
DataType: DNA
Substitution Matrix: GTR




RAxML was called as follows:

raxmlHPC-PTHREADS -T 8 -f A -n result -s infile.txt -m GTRGAMMA -p 12345 -t tree.tre -O
