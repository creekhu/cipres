This is how Sherry said VIPR would be using raxmlhpc2bb in their Sept 2014 release.
User will only be able to set runtime and protein matrix.  They must also set
datatype=protein in order to set protein matrix.

These all pass validation as of 6/23/2014.  I only tried submtting ptm1 to run.  It ran fine.


2/23/2015 - ptm1 has been changed and it no longer runs.  You don't put "vparam" in the
testParam.properties files ...
