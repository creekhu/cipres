This test fails because it sets two mutually exclusive switches:

auto_analysis=0
configure_analysis_=1

We require that all user supplied parameters end up being enabled 
(because it would be difficult to know, when one ends up disabled,
whether it does what the user intended or not).  In this case, the
user can achieve what he wants by simply turning on the switch
he wants to use: configure_analysis_=1 and omitting the other.
