Using raxml generic_ parameter.

User can enter anything in whitelist chars, except our validation
for generic parameter makes sure each arg is entered separately
with a hyphen or double hyphen and we don't allow -w and -T.

This test gives an error message because we set generic_=-ab.
In other words the arguments aren't given separately, 2 are clumped together.
