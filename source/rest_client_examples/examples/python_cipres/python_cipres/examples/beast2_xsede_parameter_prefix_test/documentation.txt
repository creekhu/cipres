This example is a copy of beast2_xsede, except that here
we specify the properties exactly as documented in the User Guide
and on the Tool Specific Parameter pages.  

In other words, tool is specified with a property named "tool" instead 
of "toolId", properties in testParam.properties are prefixed with "vparam."
and those in testInput.properties are prefixed with "input.".
