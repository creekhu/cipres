A file with a mb block submits this parameter map:

Covarionopts_=0 
Parsmodelopts_=0 
flagdatatype_=dna 
mrbayesblockquery_=1 
nchains_specified_=4 
nruns_specified_=2 
reportancstateopts_=0 
reportposselopts_=0 
reportsiterateopts_=0 
runtime_=0.1 
scientific_=0 
set_beagle_params_=1 
set_outgroup=

of these, the following are relevant and settable in the interface:
runtime_=0.1 (default) 
mrbayesblockquery_=1 (switch, 0 or 1) 
nchains_specified_=4 (The value entered for nruns and nchains influences the number of cpu's that can be used in parallel,
can be up to 16 each, and the product of the two must not exceed 16. Thes emust agree with the information in the MRBAYES block)
nruns_specified_=2
