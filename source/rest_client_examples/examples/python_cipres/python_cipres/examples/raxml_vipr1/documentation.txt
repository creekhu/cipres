This test suite covers the ViPR use case where no bootstrapping is used, with DNA data:

tool=RAXMLHPC2_TGB
vparam.runtime_=168 (we use cipres run wall time as suggested by you)
vparam.bootstrap_seed_=0 (this will be 0 for non-bootstrapping)
vparam.dna_gtrcat_=GTRGAMMA for dna sequences
At present we must set vparam.bootstrap_seed_=0


Generates the command line:
raxmlHPC-PTHREADS      -n result -s infile.txt    -p 12345      -m GTRGAMMA '
