<h2>CLIQUE</h2>
<p>
	<strong>CLIQUE</strong> finds the largest clique of 
	mutually compatible characters, and the phylogeny which they recommend, for 
	discrete character data with two states. The largest clique (or all cliques 
	within a given size range of the largest one) are found by a very fast branch 
	and bound search method. The method does not allow for missing data. For such 
	cases the T (Threshold) option of PARS or MIX may be a useful alternative. 
	Compatibility methods are particular useful when some characters are of poor 
	quality and the rest of good quality, but when it is not known in advance which 
	ones are which. Part of Phylip package.
