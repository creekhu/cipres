<h2>PSIBLAST</h2>
<p>
	<strong>PSIBLAST</strong> = Position specific iterative BLAST refers to a feature of
	BLAST in which a profile (or position specific scoring matrix, PSSM) is constructed
	(automatically) from a multiple alignment of the highest scoring hits in an initial
	BLAST search. The PSSM is generated by calculating position-specific scores for each
	position in the alignment. Highly conserved positions receive high scores and weakly
	conserved positions receive scores near zero. The profile is used to perform a second
	(etc.) BLAST search and the results of each &quot;iteration&quot; used to refine the
	profile. This iterative searching strategy results in increased sensitivity.
