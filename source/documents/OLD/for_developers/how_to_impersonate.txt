In AuthenticationInterceptor.java, I added a way for an ADMIN user to impersonate any other user 
without knowing his password.  To use it, login as an administrator, go to "my profile" (other 
locations work just as well, but you definitely don't want to do this on the login url), and 
then modify url in brower, adding query parameter ?impersonate=username
and tell the browser to go to that url.  Now go to Home tab and you should see that user's 
folders as well as a "Welcome username ..." message with the name of the user you're impersonating.

Example url: http://localhost:7070/portal2/profile.action?impersonate=test1
to impersonate the test1 user.  Note that you have to refresh the page to see
test1's profile.

Be sure to logout when done!

TODO
1) figure out what happens if the user you're impersonating is logged in, or logs in
while you're impersonating.
2) Implement a way to enable/disable this feature.  Maybe build time so we don't add the
overhead of checking something to each request.
