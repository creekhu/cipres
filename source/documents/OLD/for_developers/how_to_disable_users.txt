You turn off user submissions by using a script in the sdk/script directory called userCanSubmit.

The script takes two arguments, the username of the account and a boolean value that indicates whether or not the user can submit jobs.

To run the script, oo to the sdk/scripts directory on portal2prod.

For user mamiller, type

userCanSubmit  mamiller  false

The application will respond with an acknowledgement:

Task submission disabled for user mamiller

If there is blank space in the user name, you must enclose it in quotes.

userCanSubmit  “Julia Roberts”  false

The utility will throw an exception if the user isn't found in the database.

If you don’t enclose with blank space, and there is a user named Julia, Julia's submission rights get disabled because the utility tries to interpret the second argument as a boolean value. Java handles by considering anything other than the string "true" as false, so the string "Christenson" is interpreted as false. 

If you only give the user name as an argument, the script will print out the user's current submission status. You can use that feature to check for user existence.
