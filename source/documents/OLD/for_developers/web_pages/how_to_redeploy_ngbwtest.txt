
Here's how you pick up changes and redeploy new things on the test ngbw system/  The process is the same as for cipres.

Test runs under account ngbwtest@8ball.sdsc.edu, 
Production runs under ngbwprod@snooker.sdsc.edu.

Passwords are the same as for cipres.
* We deploy from branch_ngbw-1.6

Just a reminder, the process in general is to log into the test account, 
commit your changes to the branch and trunk and deploy *from the branch,
on the test machine* before deploying to production.  Once that works, log
into the production account, edit my "doit.sh" script (just change the "tag="
line so that tag reads "ngbw-1.6.5") and run doit.sh.  Doit.sh creates the new
tag from the head of the branch and deploys it.

The way we've sometimes handled this in the past is that you take care of
committing to the branch and trunk and deploying the branch on the test machine
and then when you tell me it's ready I just log into production, edit and run doit.sh.

The url for the test version of ngbw is http://8ball.sdsc.edu:9070/web, according to my notes.
