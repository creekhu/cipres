Job_stat record has 3 fields, su_predicted, su_computed, su_charged.

- su_predicted will be set at time job is submitted, based on max run hours requested and CORES and
CHARGEFACTOR from scheduler.conf.

- su_computed is set in BaseProcessWorker.getResults().  Run hours is determined from dates in 
start.txt and done.txt or term.txt.

- su_charged comes from tgusage or xdusage database.  There can be a 2 - 3 day delay in getting
this info, once the job has finished running.

- su_override: need to add this column to handle credits (or any other overrides).

When we figure out how many sus a user has used during the billing cycle, in general,
we sum the info for all his job_stat records that fall in the cycle, and use the most
accurate of the 4 fields above that has a value.  So we'll use su_predicted if it's the only
one set, but once the job completes, we should be abel to use su_computed instead, and once
we get the real charge from xdusage, that's what goes into the sum.  Finally, if we get sus
creditted back to our account for a failed job, we'll enter the new value in su_creditted and use
that to compute the users total.

We set the job_stat.su* fields this way for XSEDE and TSCC jobs, but not SSHProcessWorker jobs.
However, on task create page and elsewhere, we're only interested in XSEDE jobs, since we don't 
charge or set quotas for TSCC jobs.  We only include jobs where job_stats.TG_CHARGE_NUMBER is not 
null.

More about su_computed:
- we aren't able to reliably create done.txt or term.txt with timestamp contents when job 
timesout or is killed.  Will switch to using a prolog.  Could also say that if we can't
figure out the actual runtime we'll use the max specified in scheduler.conf (I need to make
sure all tools have runtime_ as a required parameter).

- another way to approach this: use job completion emails.  Can I run a script whenever a job
completion email is received to update job_stat.su_charged?

When we get sus refunded, is info in xdusage db corrected?
