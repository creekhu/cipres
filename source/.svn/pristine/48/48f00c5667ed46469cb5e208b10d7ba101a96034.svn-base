We run a test version of ngbw at http://8ball.sdsc.edu/web and the production version at
http://snooker.sdsc.edu/web.  Normally Jeremy is in charge of deployment, but sometimes
other developers need to redeploy the test server, and in an emergency we may need
to redploy to production.

There are three different versions of the passwords jar: passwords-dev-2.0.jar,
passwords-test-2.0.jar and passwords-prod-2.0.jar.  The dev and test versions
connect to the test database.  Test has a larger connection pool than dev.  The
prod version connects to the production database.

DEPLOYING TEST NGBW ON 8BALL
=============================================================================
1. Build the sdk

Either make sure that you have passwords-test-2.0.jar installed as passwords.jar in
your .m2 repo, or (the recommended approach) make the same password.jar structures in  your
repo, except replace passwords.jar with passwords-*.jar, so that you have:

  ~.m2/repository/org/ngbw/passwords-test/2.0/passwords-test-2.0.jar
  ~.m2/repository/org/ngbw/passwords-prod/2.0/passwords-prod-2.0.jar

and leave ~.m2/repository/org/ngbw/passwords/2.0/passwords-2.0.jar as the development
version.  In this case, build the sdk as "mvn clean install -Denv=test".

In a pinch, it wouldn't be a disaster to build the sdk with passwords-dev.jar.

2. Build the web

"mvn clean install -Devn=dev".  
(Note that it's env=test for sdk, but env=dev for the web project).

3. Deploy

Log in to the Tomcat manager application at http://8ball.sdsc.edu/manager/html.  The login information 
for this page is:
 
	Username: manager
	Password: Sn00ker
  
Once you are there, follow these steps:
	1. Undeploy the web application by clicking "Undeploy" on the right end of the "/web" table row.
	2. Restart the Tomcat server, by logging into 8ball and executing these commands:
		a. sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat.8ball.sh stop
		b. sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat.8ball.sh start
	3. Click "List Applications" near the upper left of the manager page, to force the phantom webapp 
	remnant to reappear in the list.
	4. If "/web" appears again, get rid of it for good by clicking "Undeploy" one more time.
	5. Deploy the newly built war file by selecting it in the "Select WAR file to upload" upload 
	field near the bottom of the page, and click "Deploy".

This should complete the deployment process.  It is definitely slower than deploying automatically as part of the Maven build, but it's really not that time-consuming if you don't need to redeploy very often
