# In this test, we've split testdata.txt into 2 parts, testdata1.txt (2000 bytes)
# and testdata2.txt (299) bytes.  We'll do HEAD commands before and after each
# PATCH to see how many bytes the server says it's received.

# From tus.io protcol spec, regarding HEAD:
# Server must always return Upload-Offset and Upload-Length if the upload exists.
# If upload doesn't exist, server must return 404, 410 or 403, without Upload-Offset header.
# Server must prevent caching by sending Cache-Control: no store header
