This is a skeleton of a web application that uses CIPRES REST API and UMBRELLA authentication.

A real web application would have some sort of user registration, but this example doesn't.
Instead, in this example, you enter all the required user info, on the login screen, each
time you start a session.  Whatever you enter on the login form will be sent to the CRA,
in the cipres-eu headers, when you do something that requires communication with the CRA like 
"List Tasks" or "Create Task".  At that point you may see an Authentication Error, returned 
from the CRA, if, for example, you've entered an invalid country code or you use the same 
email address as another user.  (Please note that the country code must be 2 letters, all caps.)

Note that you can enter any login name you like; it doesn't need to be something that you
previously registered with the CRA.  When UMBRELLA auth is used, the CRA treats the application name + 
username pair as a unique user ID.  If it doesn't find the pair in its database, it automatically 
creates an account for the user.  Thus there is no need for end users of an UMBRELLA application 
to register with the CRA.

Also note:
- The maximum job runtime is capped at 1 min.
- The example does NO validation of what you enter on the Create Task form.  Bad inputs will
be passed on the CRA and you'll have plenty of opportunity to see the kinds of validation 
error messages the CRA can return.
